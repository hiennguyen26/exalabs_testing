    "summary": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury released a report on Managing Artificial Intelligence-Specific Cybersecurity Risks in the Financial Services Sector (March 27, 2024).  The report, mandated by Presidential Executive Order 14110, addresses the challenges and opportunities AI presents to financial security and resilience.  Key concerns highlighted include a growing capability gap between large and small institutions in developing AI systems, a lack of fraud data sharing hindering effective fraud prevention models, and concerns over regulatory fragmentation regarding AI oversight.  The report proposes several next steps, including addressing the capability gap, narrowing the fraud data divide, improving regulatory coordination, expanding the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and developing best practices for data supply chain mapping.

      "Financial institutions should anticipate increased regulatory attention and scrutiny across several key domains in 2024. The regulatory environment for financial institutions in the U.S. continues to remain challenging through the beginning of 2024. Bank executives and directors should pay close attention to several critical issues that could shape the regulatory environment and supervisory priorities through the remainder of the year. While economic uncertainty, evolving technology, and mounting competitive pressures add complexity, adopting a proactive stance and sharpened focus on a few select areas can help organizations meet rising supervisory expectations. Anticipating developments in the following five areas can help banks stay ahead of examination priorities, identify potential gaps, and demonstrate a commitment to sound risk management."

    "summary": "This Crowe article discusses the increased regulatory scrutiny financial institutions (especially those over $100 billion in assets) face in 2024.  Regulators will focus on five key areas: liquidity risk management (including interest rate risk, with emphasis on contingency funding plans as detailed in the July 2023 OCC bulletin [https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2023/bulletin-2023-25.html]), third-party risk management, anti-money laundering (AML), cybersecurity, and operational resilience.  The article emphasizes proactive risk management strategies and suggests that asset-liability committees (ALCOs) and risk committees play a crucial role in meeting these heightened expectations.

      "Date Written: January 29, 2024 Abstract Combating illicit financial activity in permissionless blockchain-based financial systems \u2014 referred to as \u201cdecentralized finance\u201d or \u201cDeFi\u201d \u2014 has challenged regulators and policymakers. Traditional financial integrity laws and regulations, comprised of antimoney laundering (\u201cAML\u201d)/countering the financing of terrorism (\u201cCFT\u201d) and sanctions, attach to intermediaries, including, with respect to AML/CFT obligations, those intermediaries the Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) defines as \u201cfinancial institutions.\u201d The current laws, however, are not amenable to intermediary-less systems like DeFi. This paper proposes a framework (see Section III) to effectively detect, deter and prevent illicit financial activity in DeFi, while preserving the technology as permissionless, neutral infrastructure. The three-part proposal (1) sets forth a definition of \u201cindependent control\u201d in order to identify smart-contract based financial protocols that do not constitute DeFi; (2) seeks to classify genuine DeFi protocols \u2014 neutral, decentralized software \u2014 as \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d subject to oversight and security coordination by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (\u201cOCCIP\u201d); and (3) suggests that new laws could require certain businesses that are (a) necessary to the transmittal of communications about DeFi transactions, (b) transmit a material portion of such communications and (c) offer the service as a business to take on additional illicit finance risk management practices, without becoming \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d subject to the BSA. This paper is intended to begin a meaningful conversation about how to achieve the policy goals of combating illicit financial activities while allowing for continued innovation in DeFi, a nascent technological sector."

It suggests defining \"genuine\" DeFi as neutral, decentralized software and classifying it as critical infrastructure, overseen by the Treasury Department.  The framework also proposes requiring certain businesses facilitating DeFi communications to adopt additional illicit finance risk management practices, without becoming regulated \"financial institutions.\"  The goal is to balance anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing efforts with the growth of DeFi.\n"

Key findings reveal that while the 2020 Anti-Money Laundering Act aims to modernize these efforts, FinCEN's progress updates to Congress and the public are incomplete.  Financial institutions suggest improvements to suspicious activity reporting (SAR) processes, including more timely threat updates.  Furthermore,  FinCEN's surveys of law enforcement satisfaction have low response rates, compromising reliability.
