The report reveals 1.6 million reports (42% of all reports), totaling $212 billion in suspicious activity.  Key findings include the prevalence of fraud, false records, identity theft, third-party money laundering, and circumvention of verification standards (accounting for 88% of reports and 74% of the total amount).  Depository institutions filed the most reports (54%), while money services businesses most often reported verification circumvention.  The report highlights the disproportionate financial impact of compromised credentials.  The FTA doesn't appear to include a direct PDF link within the provided text.

The proposed rule mandates reasonable procedures to verify customer identities, making it harder for criminals to use false identities.

      "Date Written: January 29, 2024 Abstract Combating illicit financial activity in permissionless blockchain-based financial systems \u2014 referred to as \u201cdecentralized finance\u201d or \u201cDeFi\u201d \u2014 has challenged regulators and policymakers. Traditional financial integrity laws and regulations, comprised of antimoney laundering (\u201cAML\u201d)/countering the financing of terrorism (\u201cCFT\u201d) and sanctions, attach to intermediaries, including, with respect to AML/CFT obligations, those intermediaries the Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) defines as \u201cfinancial institutions.\u201d The current laws, however, are not amenable to intermediary-less systems like DeFi. This paper proposes a framework (see Section III) to effectively detect, deter and prevent illicit financial activity in DeFi, while preserving the technology as permissionless, neutral infrastructure. The three-part proposal (1) sets forth a definition of \u201cindependent control\u201d in order to identify smart-contract based financial protocols that do not constitute DeFi; (2) seeks to classify genuine DeFi protocols \u2014 neutral, decentralized software \u2014 as \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d subject to oversight and security coordination by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (\u201cOCCIP\u201d); and (3) suggests that new laws could require certain businesses that are (a) necessary to the transmittal of communications about DeFi transactions, (b) transmit a material portion of such communications and (c) offer the service as a business to take on additional illicit finance risk management practices, without becoming \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d subject to the BSA. This paper is intended to begin a meaningful conversation about how to achieve the policy goals of combating illicit financial activities while allowing for continued innovation in DeFi, a nascent technological sector."

It suggests defining \"independent control\" to distinguish genuine DeFi from centralized systems, classifying genuine DeFi as \"critical infrastructure\" under the Treasury Department's OCCIP, and imposing AML/CFT-related risk management practices on businesses facilitating DeFi communications, without designating them as \"financial institutions\" under the BSA.  The goal is to balance combating illicit activities with fostering DeFi innovation.\n"
