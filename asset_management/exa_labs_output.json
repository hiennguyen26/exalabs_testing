Your team has made a solid start at mounting defenses to ward off hackers and ransomware attacks. As cybersecurity threats continue to mount, you need to show improvements over time to your CEO and customers. How do you measure your progress and present it using meaningful, numerical details? You might want a road map for creating a practical information security measurement program, and you\u2019ll find it in newly revised draft guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."

    "summary": "NIST has released a revised draft of Special Publication (SP) 800-55 Revision 2: *Measurement Guide for Information Security*, a two-volume guide to help organizations measure and improve their cybersecurity programs.  The guide emphasizes moving from qualitative risk descriptions (e.g., high, medium, low) to quantitative data.  Volume 1 is for information security specialists, focusing on selecting and evaluating security measures. Volume 2 targets C-suite executives, showing how to develop an information security measurement program.  The publication is designed to work with frameworks like NIST's Cybersecurity Framework and Risk Management Framework.  While no direct PDF link is provided in the text, the article links to the individual volumes: [Volume 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/55/v1/ipd) and [Volume 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/55/v2/ipd).

    "summary": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury released a report on Managing Artificial Intelligence-Specific Cybersecurity Risks in the Financial Services Sector (March 27, 2024).  The report, mandated by Executive Order 14110, highlights the opportunities and challenges AI presents to financial security.  Key concerns include a growing capability gap between large and small institutions in developing AI systems, insufficient data sharing for fraud prevention, and regulatory fragmentation.  The report suggests expanding the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, developing best practices for data supply chain mapping, and creating \"nutrition labels\" for data clarity.

It is about a suite of resources that can be customized and used individually or in combination over time as an organization\u2019s cybersecurity needs change and its capabilities evolve.\u201d The CSF 2.0, which supports implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy , has an expanded scope that goes beyond protecting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and power plants, to all organizations in any sector. It also has a new focus on governance, which encompasses how organizations make and carry out informed decisions on cybersecurity strategy. The CSF\u2019s governance component emphasizes that cybersecurity is a major source of enterprise risk that senior leaders should consider alongside others such as finance and reputation. \u201cDeveloped by working closely with stakeholders and reflecting the most recent cybersecurity challenges and management practices, this update aims to make the framework even more relevant to a wider swath of users in the United States and abroad,\u201d according to Kevin Stine, chief of NIST\u2019s Applied Cybersecurity Division."

The development of the Cloud Lexicon was led by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and will enable CSPs and financial services sector institutions of all sizes to speak in standardized terms when negotiating contract terms, establishing security schema, and adhering to regulatory standards. The document is based on a review of publications from several standard setting bodies and industry associations, and included interviews and feedback from financial institutions, regulators, and CSPs. The Coordinated Information Sharing and Examinations Initiative , led by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), is a collaborative effort that addresses coordination of examinations and information sharing related to CSPs, under the respective agency\u2019s legal authorities.

As part of the digitalisation of the financial services sector, financial institutions have increased their dependencies on third-party service providers in supporting critical shared services in recent years. This can bring multiple benefits to financial institutions, including flexibility, innovation and improved operational resilience. However, if not properly managed, disruption to critical shared services could affect the continued provision of critical functions, posing risks to orderly resolution and, in some cases, financial stability. The 2016 Guidance has been issued to include a supplementary note on the digitalisation of critical shared services as an addendum."
